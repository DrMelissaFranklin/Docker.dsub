He was the director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and president of the Los Alamos National Security LLC, the company that operates the laboratory. He is the former director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The University of California Board of Regents appointed Michael R. Anastasio the director of LLNL on June 4, 2002. He started on July 1, 2002. In 2005 he became the president of the Los Alamos National Security LLC, and became the director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory on June 1, 2006. During his directorship at Lawrence Livermore, the laboratory won 25 R&D 100 Awards and maintained its world-class leadership position in high-performance computing and its application to global climate modeling.\\nHe has a bachelor's degree in physics from Johns Hopkins University and earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in theoretical nuclear physics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. His career at LLNL began in 1980 as a physicist in B-Division, one of the two nuclear weapons design divisions. He participated in the development of the W87, W84, and B83 warheads and 10 nuclear tests; he was project physicist on four of these tests. In 1991, he was made B-division leader and program manager responsible for primary weapons design. From 1996 to 2001, he served as associate director for Defense and Nuclear Technologies, responsible for all activities in the laboratory's nuclear weapons program. In that capacity, he was instrumental in the development and execution of the national Stockpile Stewardship Program.  From 2001 to 2002, Anastasio served as LLNL's deputy director for Strategic Operations.\\nHe has 18 publications in intermediate energy theoretical nuclear physics and 800 citations. He received the Department of Energy Weapons Recognition of Excellence Award in 1990 and is a member of Sigma Pi Sigma, the national physics honor society; U.S. Strategic Command, Strategic Advisory Group; and the Defense Science Board Task Force on Nuclear Capabilities.\\nHe retired from his position as Laboratory Director at Los Alamos National Laboratory on June 1, 2011.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOral history interview of Michael R.

He was elected vice-president on August 14, 2005. He was defeated by the Susan Polgar-Paul Truong slate when he ran for re-election in July, 2007. He was a rated chess expert.\\n\\nChess organizer and official\\nAlthough an expert chess player, Schultz's greatest joy came in bringing people together through the many chess tournaments that he either organized or helped with. Schultz and his family were traveling from their home in Brussels, Belgium in 1971 to the United States to visit family when they stopped in Reykjavik, Iceland to see the Fischer/Spassky tournament. Bobby Fischer was a friend and asked him to stay on as one of his allowed council of three. This was the beginning of Schultz's foray into the world of international chess.  Over the next several decades, he traveled around the world for chess conferences and tournaments, often accompanied by his wife, Teresa Russ Schultz.\\nSchultz first ran for USCF President in 1966, but was defeated by Marshall Rohland. In 1981, Schultz was appointed U.S. Delegate to FIDE, the World Chess Federation. In 1982, in Thessaloniki, Schultz was elected to the Executive Council of FIDE.\\nIn 1992, he was elected to the Policy Board of the USCF. In 1993, he organized a tour for the Israel Youth Chess Team to the US. In 1993 and 1994 he, along with Yasser Seirawan, ran a chess school for children in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. In 1996, Schultz was elected President of the USCF for a three-year term. In 2003, Schultz was elected to the Executive Board of the USCF for a four-year term. He is the author of two books, \\\"Chessdon\\\" and \\\"Fischer, Kasparov and the Others\\\". He has held numerous political positions in chess.\\nSchultz died on April 20, 2020, in Emerson, New Jersey from complications caused by the COVID-19 virus.\\n\\nState Associations\\nPresident, NYS Chess Association 1964-1965\\nPresident, North Carolina Chess Association 1966\\u20131971\\nPresident, Georgia Chess Association 1977\\u20131979\\nPresident, Florida Chess Association \\u2013 1987 -1993\\nElected Honorary Lifetime Member Florida Chess Association Board of Directors in 1996.\\nEditor floridaCHESS 1994 to 1996.
